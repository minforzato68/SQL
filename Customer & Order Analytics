#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(OrderID) AS Total_JanOrders FROM BIT_DB.Jansales WHERE length(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(OrderID) AS Total_iPhone_Orders FROM BIT_DB.Jansales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum AS Feb_Sale_Acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON order_ID = OrderID WHERE length(orderid) =6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, Sum(Quantity)*price AS REVENUE FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location LIKE('%548 lincoln%');

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.Febsales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 AND length(orderid)=6 AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Sold FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE Location LIKE '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY Product;
