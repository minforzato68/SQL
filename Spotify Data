For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the Table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data and answered questions using the following SQL.

/*What is the average song length in minutes?*/
SELECT avg(duration_ms/60000) AS Average_Duration_min FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

/* Which artits have multiple top 50 hits?*/
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS Num_Top50_Hits FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name HAVING count(artist_name)>1;

/*How many artist had more than one hit with >90 popularity and which ones were they?*/
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS Num_Hits_Pop90 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata WHERE popularity >89 GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY count(artist_name) desc limit 4;

/*What was the most common key amoung the top 10 songs?*/
SELECT song_key, max(mycount) AS Song_Key_Occurance FROM (SELECT song_key, count(song_key) AS mycount FROM (SELECT popularity, song_key FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata ORDER BY popularity desc limit 10) GROUP BY song_key HAVING mycount>1);

/*What is the average danceability amoung songs with popularity of 90 or higher?*/
SELECT round(avg(danceability),3) AS Average_Danceability FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata WHERE popularity >89;
